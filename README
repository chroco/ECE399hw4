This program generates 64000 random integers
and stores them to a binary file format. 
An array is then populated from the integers 
and a single threaded bubblesort is performed
on the array. The sort time is then reported 
along with verification that the array is sorted.
Another array is then populated with the same
random variables stored in the file and the
same sort is performed only with four threads
instead of one. The output from one of my
tests is included below. The multithreaded
sort takes about 1/10 the time as the single
threaded sort.
